# Bionic arm with AI
The project is about the construction of a 3D bionic arm that receive  input biological signals from the arm of a person, with these signals the movements of the 3D hand are controlled.

Additionally the bionic arm has a Arduino Due in which run a Support Vector Machine to classify movement based in the features calculated over the EMG signal from the arm of a person.

The next image show to the left the bionic arm printed in 3D and to the right the 3D model.
